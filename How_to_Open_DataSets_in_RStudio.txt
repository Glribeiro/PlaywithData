- 1) CSV

OBJECT_NAME <- read.csv("NAME_OF_FILE_DIRECTORY", header = TRUE, sep = ",", strings.na = "N/A", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) 

# OBJECT_NAME - the name you want to use to store the dataset as a object in R
# NAME_OF_FILE_DIRECTORY - file directory in your computer. Before this you need to define a Work Directory to your files in R - command: setwd()
# header = TRUE if you want to show the first line of yout dataset
# sep = "\t" - you define your DataSet's separator
# head(OBJECT_NAME, 4) - show the first 4 lines of your dataset - after creating the object, it will help you with the first impression of the data
# tail(OBJECT_NAME, 4) - show de last lines of your dataset
# str(OBJECT_NAME) - very important, you can see the structure of your dataset
# obs: read.table - reads a file in table format and creates a data frame from it
# NA = not available, if there are missing values in your dataset
# strings.na = "N/A" you especify you want N/A in the fields with NO values
# stringsAsFactors = FALSE - to let them as strings
# Data from Internet: OBJECT_NAME2 <- read.csv("https://github.com/.../xxx.csv") 


- 2) HTML

- 3) XML

rootnode <- xmlRoot(xmldoc)
rootnode[1] # consult the first element


- 4) JSON

install.packages("jsonlite")

- 5) ANALISIS FWF

# fwf - fixed with format

# widths - dataframe with 5 columns
# col.names - columns names

# another case with header:

OBJECT_NAME7 <- read.fwf("xxxx.txt", 
                                 widths = c(4, 15, 20, 15, 4),

# if the data starts on line 3, you use skip to jump to
